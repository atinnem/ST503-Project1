##What is XML?
  Extensible Markup Language, or XML, is a dynamic language that is similar to, but more flexible than HTML.  XML simplifies data sharing as it provides a flexible way to create information formats and electronically share structured data via the internet or corporate networks.   XML is self-defining, meaning the structure of data is embedded within the data itself.  This feature removes the need to pre-build the structure to store the data when attempting to share it.  
The main advantage of XML is itâ€™s simplicity.  It enables you to consolidate large chunks of information into an XML document which provides structure and organization to the information.  This feature facilitates the

##Where does it get used? 
XML is useful in data transfer.  Attempting to share or exchange data in incompatible formats is time consuming at best.  As XML stores data in a plain text format it is a platform independent way of storing and transporting data


##Why is it a good way to store data?
XML is a good way to store complex and highly variable data, hierarchical data,  and data in which the the format may change over time. 

## Loading libraries
```{r, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
#requiring more packages that will be helpful later to handle XML data
library(XML)
library(plyr)
library(dplyr)
```


## Reading in XML data

We found a website with many public xml datasets, some of them contain very ineteresting information.<br> (http://aiweb.cs.washington.edu/research/projects/xmltk/xmldata/www/repository.html)
Mondial is an XML dataset from World geographic database integrated from the CIA World Factbook, the International Atlas, and the TERRA database among other sources.<br>
The data is made public and able to download from washington.edu datasets repository online.

```{r Mondial}

mondialParse <- xmlParse("http://aiweb.cs.washington.edu/research/projects/xmltk/xmldata/data/mondial/mondial-3.0.xml")
class(mondialParse) # Testing to make sure that R recognizes the XML data

```

## Transforming XML into a dataframe

```{r xmlToDF}

monialDF <- ldply(xmlToList("http://aiweb.cs.washington.edu/research/projects/xmltk/xmldata/data/mondial/mondial-3.0.xml"), data.frame)
view(mondialDF) # Tried the code above but result in an error: arguments imply differing number of rows: 1, 4, 2, 14

```
